    - The two brothers Aman and Gavin came across the site which in its former life certainly has a few stories, as we’re sure many laybys do! It primarily served as a toilet block which you wouldn’t think acts as the greatest inspiration.

    - But the vision was there to create a chippy to serve all the villages dotted between York and Pocklington, as well as serving annual pilgrims going to the coast and camp sites around. In time, we’ve become everyone’s local.

    - The real art is in the consistency. It is our mission to make sure the customer trusts these are the best fish and chips around. Choosing the right potato, constantly managing our dripping, making our batter in batches, frying to order…the list could go on but consistency is key so whether it’s a Monday lunch time treat or a family Friday feast, you can be sure our mission is front of mind.

    - Whilst the chippy doesn’t scream healthy, it's certainly one of the best takeaways that gym bros and healthy living gurus can unite around. Cod and Haddock are a rich source of omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants. Being a natural product straight from the sea, with no added ingredients and packed with protein, a good chippy provides a guilt free indulgence.

    - Our fish is sourced from sustainable sources. The fish you will most likely be served will come off the coast of Norway or Iceland, where the cold waters of the North Atlantic and Norweigen sea produce some incredibly strong and tasty fish. You’ll see when you come in exactly where our fish have come from on any given day. We mainly serve haddock with it’s slightly stronger flavour profile, but we also offer cod which is deliciously delicate and flaky. We will soon be introducing more sustainable options, as well as grilled fish options.

- title: Our Dripping
  copy:
    - A potato is made up of starch and about 80% water. It is the heat of the frying medium that turns this water into steam. Whilst softening the inside, the steam escaping creates the brown crispiness on the outside. The chip is therefore, by definition, a potato in which the water has been replaced by fat. So, it’s incredibly important time and effort goes into sourcing and maintaining the frying medium, which in our case is the Yorkshire favourite, dripping.

    - The other benefits in frying in hard fats is that they’re stable. In the 90s fat became the dietary villain, but its stable nature has recently returned it as a kitchen staple for chefs and bakers alike. Since it can keep its profile at high temperatures, it makes for the perfect medium to fry our fish and chips in, as well as providing that distinctive meaty flavour.

    - The perfect chip shop chip starts with the perfect potato. Depending on the time of year and potato variety we try to make sure we get the best and most consistent spud. Once in house, we cook them fresh by first blanching at a low temperature before finishing at a high temperature to get that golden outside and fluffy middle.

#     - The sacred scrap needs to be acknowledged, for - like vowels - they are one of those things that help identify northerners from      southerners. They are delicious. And they should always be free.

#     - "'You cant get out for nowt' said every Yorkshireman ever. Well, young tykes, despite some places horrendously starting to charge for them, or some councils vying for their demise, scraps remain one of the few things you can get without parting with a penny."
#     - But, nothing so wonderful can be given by the batter Gods without something being taken away. Scraps, despite their giving ways, have also been the downfall of many a chippie. Up and down the land, time and time again, fryers have turned up on morning to realise the devastation that can be caused by the spontaneous combustion of these humble bits of batter.
#     - Come and help yourself from the scrap box. They don't really need any accompaniment as the beef dripping gives them all the flavour they need, but a dash of salt n vinegar won't go amiss!

#     - It's currently in vogue to use dripping for almost anything these days. Mary Berry uses it in her lasagne, James Martin says it’s the 'secret' to his fruit cake and Heston Blumenthal swears by it for 'perfect' roast potatoes. These chefs are only now realising the flavoursome qualities of the decades old practice we’ve been using for decades up int' North.
#     - Dripping is essentially animal fat that has melted and dripped from roasting meat. Rendering fat separates it from connective tissue and meat, processing it into a clear liquid, free of impurities. It's essentially turning a waste material into useful – and incredibly tasty – produce. The flavour benefits are unsurprisingly greater than if you stick to oil.

#     - Theres one more point to make about the cooking medium, and that's its quality and upkeep. Here at the scrap box we have the newest technology that allows us to filter our pans daily really well and we are always putting in new fat so that you can be sure our crispy batter will still be as flavoursome and delicious as the last time.
#     - They always ask about the ‘secret’ behind great fish and chips, when there really isn't one beyond doing every small component right. But if we had to point to one more than any other it would be the purity and upkeep of the cooking medium – imagine drinking tea with murky water – it's the same principle with fat and fish and chips for us at the scrap box.
